                <h2>Software Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been writing software both professionally and recreationally for over 5 years. I have
                    experience with both front-end and back-end web development, and am familiar with the development of
                    mobile applications, and a variety of other domains, like game development.
                </p>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I love to create interesting logos and content, in line with modern design trends. I am familiar
                    with the latest guidelines and frequently create new designs from scratch. These designs are
                    friendly to assistive devices like screen readers. They will easily adapt to suit your brand, with
                    minimal effort on your end.
                </p>
                <h2>Business</h2>
                <p>
                    New ideas excite me, and I have been studying business and management strategies at school. I took
                    our school's Virtual Enterprise class, in which we took a business off the ground and running. Over
                    the course of the school year, we took in about 100 orders.
                </p>
                <h2>Scouting</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an avid camper, and I have been a proud member of Scouts BSA for around 7 years. I have gained
                    experience leading others through my time as a Patrol Leader and as the troop's Senior Patrol
                    Leader. I am a Star Scout, and am on track to earn Eagle.
