        <h2>Fellow, MLH</h2>
    </div>
    
As a Major League Hacking Fellow, I worked on BentoML, a high-performance model-serving server. I worked on things all over the 
project, from removing all warnings from tests in master to one of the project's largest refactors that halved the amount of code 
required for a typical contribution.
